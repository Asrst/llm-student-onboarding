In general, you cannot directly\nregister for the advanced classes without completing the prerequisites in a prior semester . Note that\nconcurrent enrollment in prerequisite and advanced classes is not allowed.  \nIn addition, certain core MS-BAIS classes like Advanced Database Management have pre-program\nprerequisites such as a database prerequisite, which can be met by virtue of a prior course in database\nmanagement from your previous university or adequate working experience with databases in a corporate\nenvironment. Similarly , there are prerequisites for Advanced Systems Analysis & Design and Distributed\nInformation Systems. If you don't meet these core prerequisites, you will have to register for basic courses in\nthese areas at USF and these courses will NOT  count toward the 33-credit MS-BAIS degree requirement.

What are the consequences of violating academic integrity?,"['Academic Integrity\nThe MS-BAIS program follow USF\'s of ficial policies on academic integrity , which are described in detail at\nhttps://www .usf.edu/undergrad/students/ethics-integrity .aspx\n(https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/students/ethics-integrity.aspx) . We encourage you to read through this page\nto familiarize yourself of our of ficial policy and consequences for violations. Students are routinely expelled\nfrom USF (without degree) every year for violations of our of ficial academic integrity policies. ""I did not know""\nor ""This is not considered plagiarism in the culture where I\'m from"" will not be considered an acceptable\nexcuse if you happen to be involved in any of these transgressions. \n \nWhat are violations of academic integrity?\nCheating : Cheating is using or attempting to use materials, information, notes, study aids, or other\nassistance in any assignment, group work, examination, or evaluation that have not been authorized by the\ninstructor .\nPlagiarism : Plagiarism is representing someone else\'s work as your own. For example, you download\nmaterials from the internet for your class project and did not cite or give credit to the original source where\nwe took the material from. Whether intentional or not, plagiarism is an of fense liable under USF academic\nintegrity policies.\n \nWhy is this a big deal?\nThe job of a university is not only to teach, but build responsible and productive members of our society . We\ndon\'t believe we can accomplish the second goal if we allow or overlook ethical transgressions in the\nconduct of our academic and extracurricular activities. W e understand that students don\'t start with an\nintention to cheat, but are forced to do so because of circumstances such as taking too many courses in one\nsemester , try to work full-time while also taking a full academic load, and trying to be perfect for their friends\nand family . These things can put a good person in a bad situation. Before soon, ""I would never cheat""\nbecomes ""W ell, just this once"" which turns into repeated instances of cheating. It is a slippery slope from\nwhere you can\'t get out. W e must intervene to arrest the moral and intellectual slide, and hence, we\nrigorously enforce our academic integrity policies.\n \nWhat are the consequences of academic integrity violations?\nFirst, both cheating and plagiarism have the same penalty and are cumulative throughout your stay at USF ,\nmeaning they accrue over your dif ferent classes with dif ferent professors.

What are the consequences of violations of academic integrity at USF?,"['Academic Integrity\nThe MS-BAIS program follow USF\'s of ficial policies on academic integrity , which are described in detail at\nhttps://www .usf.edu/undergrad/students/ethics-integrity .aspx\n(https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/students/ethics-integrity.aspx) . We encourage you to read through this page\nto familiarize yourself of our of ficial policy and consequences for violations. Students are routinely expelled\nfrom USF (without degree) every year for violations of our of ficial academic integrity policies. ""I did not know""\nor ""This is not considered plagiarism in the culture where I\'m from"" will not be considered an acceptable\nexcuse if you happen to be involved in any of these transgressions. \n \nWhat are violations of academic integrity?\nCheating : Cheating is using or attempting to use materials, information, notes, study aids, or other\nassistance in any assignment, group work, examination, or evaluation that have not been authorized by the\ninstructor .\nPlagiarism : Plagiarism is representing someone else\'s work as your own. For example, you download\nmaterials from the internet for your class project and did not cite or give credit to the original source where\nwe took the material from. Whether intentional or not, plagiarism is an of fense liable under USF academic\nintegrity policies.\n \nWhy is this a big deal?\nThe job of a university is not only to teach, but build responsible and productive members of our society . We\ndon\'t believe we can accomplish the second goal if we allow or overlook ethical transgressions in the\nconduct of our academic and extracurricular activities. W e understand that students don\'t start with an\nintention to cheat, but are forced to do so because of circumstances such as taking too many courses in one\nsemester , try to work full-time while also taking a full academic load, and trying to be perfect for their friends\nand family . These things can put a good person in a bad situation. Before soon, ""I would never cheat""\nbecomes ""W ell, just this once"" which turns into repeated instances of cheating. It is a slippery slope from\nwhere you can\'t get out. W e must intervene to arrest the moral and intellectual slide, and hence, we\nrigorously enforce our academic integrity policies.\n \nWhat are the consequences of academic integrity violations?\nFirst, both cheating and plagiarism have the same penalty and are cumulative throughout your stay at USF ,\nmeaning they accrue over your dif ferent classes with dif ferent professors. The USF of ficial policy for\ntransgressions can be found at https://usf.app.box.com/v/usfregulation3027\n(https://usf.app.box.com/v/usfregulation3027)\nIn general, we follow the following rules:\nFirst of fense:\nZero in the concerned assignment or exam.']","The consequences of violations of academic integrity at USF include receiving a zero in the concerned assignment or exam for a first offense.

Online courses will always have Of f-Campus in the Campus field.  Synchronous online\ncourses will contain a note that gives the dates on which the classes meet.  If there is no such note, the\nclass is asynchronous, even though the Time field will say TBA.  The system will not allow us not to put a\ntime in that field.  \nNotes:\n1. The Off-Campus  note is likely to be followed by the name of a campus (e.g., Off-Campus - T ampa , or\nOff-Campus - Sarasota-Manatee ).  Ignore the name of the campus.  This is included for internal financial\npurposes and does not af fect how the course is delivered.\n2. Online courses are a little more expensive than face-to-face courses.  USF charges an additional fee for\nonline courses.  At the moment, the charge is $30.\n3. If you are an international student, you must take the majority of your courses on your home campus,\nwhich is Tampa.  Since the face-to-face classes are in general Tampa classes, this is not a problem for\nmost semesters, but it may become an issue for your last semester .

Many other departments and centers\nsuch as Center for Urban Transportation Research (CUTR), INT O USF , USF IT , USF Provost's Of fice, USF\nLibrary , etc. provide GA/T A opportunities for technically qualified students. Since programming skills are\noften valued for many of these positions, our BAIS students often find on-campus employment opportunities\nat many of these departments.\n \nWhat are the job requirements of these positions?\nIn TA positions, you are typically helping a professor with a certain class (e.g., statistics). So you need a\nstrong background in that content to qualify for a TA in that class. For example, if Dr . Bhattacherjee needs a\nTA for his Statistical Data Modeling class, he will require that you take that class and perform well in the\nclass to be considered as his TA for that class.\nIn GA  positions, you are helping a center/lab with research, data collection, or other ef forts.

What is the purpose of CPT internships in a professional workplace?,"[""CPT Internships\nWhat are CPT internships?\nCurricular Practical Training (CPT) are training/learning opportunities related to your curriculum (business\nanalytics & information systems) in real-world businesses. These internships may be paid or unpaid, on-site\nor remote, full-time (more than 20 hours/week) or part-time (20 hours or less  per week), and can be done in\nany semester of the year (Summer , Fall, or Spring). There are dif ferent course registration requirements for\nfull-time vs. part-time internships, so read on below . Note that we do not authorize unpaid internships, and\nwe also do not approve internships that are unrelated to your curriculum (e.g., internships in finance or\nmarketing).\nCPT internships are not required to graduate from the BAIS program, but are strongly encouraged, as they\nare an opportunity for you to showcase your skills in a professional workplace and build domain knowledge,\nwhich are both invaluable in securing employment after graduation, and they provide you with an additional\nsource of income. W e have seen numerous instances where internship employers of fered their interns full-\ntime positions upon graduation.\nAlso note that CPT  internship is NOT  a job; it's a learning opportunity related to your curriculum outside of\ntraditional class lectures, or in other words, it is a practicum course (ISM 6945: BAIS Internship; 1 credit).\nHence, we must certify your internship as part of your curriculum and must ensure that you learned some\ncurriculum-related practical knowledge/experience from that internship. For this reason, CPT  internships will\nalso require you to sign up for the BAIS internship course (ISM 6945), specify which other BAIS courses\nhelped you build the skills needed for this internship, and meet the requirements of this course (e.g., first day\nattendance, end-of-term project report, etc.). At the end of the semester , you will get a\nSatisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grade in the course. You need a satisfactory grade to receive credit for this\ncourse as part of the 33-credit requirement for the BAIS degree. Note that both full-time and part-time\ninternships are 1-credit per semester .\n \nWho is eligible for CPT internships?\nCPT internships at USF are now administered by the student's major department, which in your case, is the\nSchool of Information Systems & Management (SISM). Any student who meets the following criteria is\neligible to do a BAIS internship.\n1. Complete two semesters  (Fall and Spring) of full-time coursework in residence. Students entering in Fall\nare eligible for internship in their first summer . However , students entering in Spring who have completed\nonly one semester of coursework in Spring are NOT  eligible for summer internship in their first summer at\nUSF (sorry , but this is a USCIS ruling over which we have no control).\n2. Complete the following two courses before applying for an internship: (a) QMB 6304  (Analytical Methods\nin Business) and (b) ISM 6218  (Advanced Database Management). Most students take these classes in their\nfirst semester in the BAIS program. However you still have to complete the two-semester residency\nrequirement before you are eligible for CPT  internships.\n3. Maintain a  GPA of 3.0 or higher . If your GP A falls below this level, then you are on academic probation.\nWe will need to work with you to create an action plan to improve your grades so that you can graduate on""]","The purpose of CPT internships in a professional workplace is to showcase your skills, build domain knowledge, and secure employment after graduation.

What is the difference between a Practice Center Project (PCP) and a CPT internship?,"[""Practice Center Projects\nWhat is a Practice Center Project?\nPractice Center Projects (PCP) are corporate projects of a predefined scope that recruit two students to work\ncollaboratively on one project aided by a corporate sponsor and a BAIS professor . This is a paid\nengagement, and if selected, you will be paid for up to 20 hours/week by the corporate employer .\n \nHow is PCP  different from CPT internship?\n1. Internship is an individual project and an arrangement between you and the employer . PCP  is a\ncollaborative project, involving two students and one professor , and is an arrangement between the School\nof Information Systems and Management (SISM), that of fers the BAIS degree, and the employer . The\nemployer pays SISM and SISM pays you for your work.\n2. In internships, you are working alone, but in a PCP , you are working with another student and you are\nhelped by a professor .\n3. Another dif ference between PCP  and CPT  internship is that you must complete one academic year of\nstudy to qualify for CPT  internship, but you can get a PCP  in your first year . Whether you are selected\ndepends on what skill set the corporate employer is looking for and whether that fits with your skill set.\nHowever , like internships, PCP  also spans one semester (typically Fall or Spring, but not summer).\n \nHow can you sign up for PCP?\nUnlike internships, where you have to get your own internship, PCP  is arranged by SISM. Corporate\nemployers approach SISM with their projects every semester . Anna sends out e-mails to students indicating\nthese projects usually before the start of Fall and Spring semesters. You can send in your resumes to Anna,\nindicating which PCPs you are interest it. The corporate sponsor will review all resumes and shortlist\ncandidates for interview . Following your interviews, candidates will be notified of their interview results. Make\nsure that you are on Anna's e-mail list to receive these PCP  e-mails.""]","The difference between a Practice Center Project (PCP) and a CPT internship is that PCP is a collaborative project involving two students and one professor, while an internship is an individual project between the student and the employer.

During this time, we will not allow you to be distracted by internships, GA/T A-ship, or other activities.\nNOTE: If you are an international students, and you have completed all the requirements for the program,\nyou cannot apply for an internship unless you also register for another course.  In other words, you cannot\npostpone your graduation by enrolling for an internship alone.\n \nWhat are the rules and restrictions on doing CPT internships? \nInternships may be full-time or part-time. You are allowed to do full-time or part-time internships for a\nmaximum of 364 days . Exceeding this limit will disqualify you from participating in the  Optional Practical\nTraining (OPT) upon completion of your degree. If you are an international student, you will need those 18\nmonths of OPT  to transition from the F1 student visa to a H1B worker's visa. You are therefore allowed a\nmaximum of 3 credits for CPT  internships.\nFor both full-time and part-time internships, you will have to register for the ISM 6945 (BAIS Internship)\ncourse for each semester that you do the internship, and demonstrate what curriculum-related knowledge\nyou acquired from the internship. Because all USF courses (including ISM 6945) are organized by\nsemesters, if you are doing an internship that starts in say July (Summer) and ends in September (Fall), then\nyou will need to register for ISM 6945 twice: for Summer and then again for Fall, for this internship, and this\ninternship will consume two of the three credit hours allowed for internships. You can use the same of fer\nletter for both internship applications, but the application for each semester must be submitted and\nprocessed separately .\nCPT internship positions must be for at least 8 weeks . If you have a Summer internship that is say 6 weeks\nlong, we will approve it only if it is also part of a Fall internship that is also at least 6 weeks in length. In this\ncase, you must fill out two internship applications, for the Summer and Fall semesters, and take a 1 credit\nclass in each semester .  \nWe allow some flexibility in your start and end dates for internships. You can start your internship up to two\nweeks before  the semester , as long as these dates don't overlap with a prior term, and end it up to two\nweeks after  the end of the semester , except in your graduating (last) semester at USF . In your final\n(graduating) semester , your internship must be completed by the of ficial end of that semester .\nYou are not allowed to do an internship and hold a GA  position in the same semester . You have to choose\nwhether you want the internship or the GA  position. W e do not want to recruit you as a GA  is you cannot\ndemonstrate your commitment to the GA  position and will quit it the moment you get a more lucrative\ninternship. W e will not approve your internship request once you are on USF payroll for your GA  job.\nYou are also not allowed to do a full-time internship, independent study , and register for classes (online or in-\nperson) in the same semester . This is to ensure that you spend adequate time and do a good job in\nwhatever you registered in for that semester .\n \nWhat are the course enrollment requirements for doing full-time or part-time internships in a given\nsemester?\nThe course enrollment requirements vary based on whether you are doing a full-time or part-time internship,\nand whether you are doing this internship in Fall, Spring, or Summer semesters.""]","The enrollment requirements for internships in a semester depend on the type and duration of the internship.

What are the eligibility criteria and rules for CPT internships in relation to the BAIS program at USF?,"[""CPT Internships\nWhat are CPT internships?\nCurricular Practical Training (CPT) are training/learning opportunities related to your curriculum (business\nanalytics & information systems) in real-world businesses. These internships may be paid or unpaid, on-site\nor remote, full-time (more than 20 hours/week) or part-time (20 hours or less  per week), and can be done in\nany semester of the year (Summer , Fall, or Spring). There are dif ferent course registration requirements for\nfull-time vs. part-time internships, so read on below . Note that we do not authorize unpaid internships, and\nwe also do not approve internships that are unrelated to your curriculum (e.g., internships in finance or\nmarketing).\nCPT internships are not required to graduate from the BAIS program, but are strongly encouraged, as they\nare an opportunity for you to showcase your skills in a professional workplace and build domain knowledge,\nwhich are both invaluable in securing employment after graduation, and they provide you with an additional\nsource of income. W e have seen numerous instances where internship employers of fered their interns full-\ntime positions upon graduation.\nAlso note that CPT  internship is NOT  a job; it's a learning opportunity related to your curriculum outside of\ntraditional class lectures, or in other words, it is a practicum course (ISM 6945: BAIS Internship; 1 credit).\nHence, we must certify your internship as part of your curriculum and must ensure that you learned some\ncurriculum-related practical knowledge/experience from that internship. For this reason, CPT  internships will\nalso require you to sign up for the BAIS internship course (ISM 6945), specify which other BAIS courses\nhelped you build the skills needed for this internship, and meet the requirements of this course (e.g., first day\nattendance, end-of-term project report, etc.). At the end of the semester , you will get a\nSatisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grade in the course. You need a satisfactory grade to receive credit for this\ncourse as part of the 33-credit requirement for the BAIS degree. Note that both full-time and part-time\ninternships are 1-credit per semester .\n \nWho is eligible for CPT internships?\nCPT internships at USF are now administered by the student's major department, which in your case, is the\nSchool of Information Systems & Management (SISM). Any student who meets the following criteria is\neligible to do a BAIS internship.\n1. Complete two semesters  (Fall and Spring) of full-time coursework in residence. Students entering in Fall\nare eligible for internship in their first summer . However , students entering in Spring who have completed\nonly one semester of coursework in Spring are NOT  eligible for summer internship in their first summer at\nUSF (sorry , but this is a USCIS ruling over which we have no control).\n2. Complete the following two courses before applying for an internship: (a) QMB 6304  (Analytical Methods\nin Business) and (b) ISM 6218  (Advanced Database Management). Most students take these classes in their\nfirst semester in the BAIS program. However you still have to complete the two-semester residency\nrequirement before you are eligible for CPT  internships.\n3. Maintain a  GPA of 3.0 or higher .

What happens if academic integrity is violated at USF and what actions are taken for different offenses?,"['Academic Integrity\nThe MS-BAIS program follow USF\'s of ficial policies on academic integrity , which are described in detail at\nhttps://www .usf.edu/undergrad/students/ethics-integrity .aspx\n(https://www.usf.edu/undergrad/students/ethics-integrity.aspx) . We encourage you to read through this page\nto familiarize yourself of our of ficial policy and consequences for violations. Students are routinely expelled\nfrom USF (without degree) every year for violations of our of ficial academic integrity policies. ""I did not know""\nor ""This is not considered plagiarism in the culture where I\'m from"" will not be considered an acceptable\nexcuse if you happen to be involved in any of these transgressions. \n \nWhat are violations of academic integrity?\nCheating : Cheating is using or attempting to use materials, information, notes, study aids, or other\nassistance in any assignment, group work, examination, or evaluation that have not been authorized by the\ninstructor .\nPlagiarism : Plagiarism is representing someone else\'s work as your own. For example, you download\nmaterials from the internet for your class project and did not cite or give credit to the original source where\nwe took the material from. Whether intentional or not, plagiarism is an of fense liable under USF academic\nintegrity policies.\n \nWhy is this a big deal?\nThe job of a university is not only to teach, but build responsible and productive members of our society . We\ndon\'t believe we can accomplish the second goal if we allow or overlook ethical transgressions in the\nconduct of our academic and extracurricular activities. W e understand that students don\'t start with an\nintention to cheat, but are forced to do so because of circumstances such as taking too many courses in one\nsemester , try to work full-time while also taking a full academic load, and trying to be perfect for their friends\nand family . These things can put a good person in a bad situation. Before soon, ""I would never cheat""\nbecomes ""W ell, just this once"" which turns into repeated instances of cheating. It is a slippery slope from\nwhere you can\'t get out. W e must intervene to arrest the moral and intellectual slide, and hence, we\nrigorously enforce our academic integrity policies.\n \nWhat are the consequences of academic integrity violations?\nFirst, both cheating and plagiarism have the same penalty and are cumulative throughout your stay at USF ,\nmeaning they accrue over your dif ferent classes with dif ferent professors. The USF of ficial policy for\ntransgressions can be found at https://usf.app.box.com/v/usfregulation3027\n(https://usf.app.box.com/v/usfregulation3027)\nIn general, we follow the following rules:\nFirst of fense:\nZero in the concerned assignment or exam.']","The consequences for violations of academic integrity at USF include receiving a zero on the concerned assignment or exam for a first offense.

What are the enrollment requirements for internships in a given semester?,"['CPT Internship F AQ\n1. How can I find an internship?\nUSF is using Handshake to help students find internships and full-time positions.  \nTo register and search openings go to https://usf.joinhandshake.com/login\n(https://usf.joinhandshake.com/login)  (https://usf.joinhandshake.com/login)\nSample search terms to use: Information systems, business analytics, data analytics, data science,\nprogramming, tech support, etc. \nFor help on using the system,  you can go to https://support.joinhandshake.com/hc/en-us\n(https://support.joinhandshake.com/hc/en-us) .  \n \n2. Can I do an internship in any semester (Summer , Fall, and Spring)?\nYes, as long as you meet the requirements of the internship (minimum two semesters of prior full-time\ncoursework, have a minimum GP A of 3.0, course prerequisites, etc.) and your internship is approved by us.\nFurthermore, your internship may be full-time or part-time, and you can do it for a maximum of 364 days.\n \n3. If I\'m working for a company and am paid by the company , why do I need USF\'s authorization to do\na CPT internship and why am I paying USF for a 1-credit class for the internship?\nInternational students on F1 student visa are NOT  allowed to work of f-campus (or even on-campus for more\nthan 20 hours/week) as a condition of your F1 visa. The only way in which you can work for an employer is if\nwe (USF) authorize that this ""work"" is related to the learning process (practical training) for which you are\nenrolled at USF . We must demonstrate to USCIS that your ""work"" is relevant to our curriculum. Hence,\ninternships are considered to be practicuum courses (ISM 6945), and you will have to register and pay for\nthis 1-credit internship course before you can join the internship, and submit a report at the end of the\nsemester to receive a grade for that course. Since USF courses are structured on a semester basis, if your\ninternship spans two semesters, you have to register separately and pay tuition for each of the two\nsemesters for which you are doing the internship.\n \n4. Can I change my CPT employer after accepting a prior of fer from a dif ferent employer?\nNo. iStart does not allow that. It also inconveniences the employer , brings disrepute to our university , and\nhurts our chances of securing internships for future students. If you do not like the terms or pay of your first\nCPT employer , do not accept their of fer and wait for the next employer . But you are not allowed to play\ngames like accept one of fer and ask for a change when you get a better of fer, or try to negotiate a better\npaying of fer by using one CPT  employer against another . If such situations come to light, we may penalize\nyou by not approving any of your CPT  applications for that semester and/or by revoking a previously\napproved CPT  application. A CPT  internship is NOT  a job that you can flip as often as you want. It is a\ncourse and if you want an internship, then you must respect the rules and meet the obligations of the course.', ""A CPT  internship is a privilege provided to international students by USCIS, and we will not allow any abuse\nof this privilege.\n \n5. Can I do a CPT internship and also do an on-campus job in the same semester?\nCurrent immigration interpretation by the Student Exchange V isitor Program (SEVP) does not address\nconcurrent CPT  and on-campus employment. But USF Of fice of International Services recommends that\nstudents who engage in concurrent CPT  and on-campus employment limit the total employment to 20\nhours/week during Fall and Spring . In light of this recommendation, we will not approve of concurrent CPT\nand on-campus employment during Fall or Spring semesters for a total of more than 20 hours/week. If a\nsituation comes to light where a student is doing 20 hours or more of internship and also doing an on-\ncampus job anywhere on USF campus, we will pull the student's internship for that semester and give that\nstudent an U grade for the internship course for violating our internship policies.\n \n6. Can I do a full-time (40-hour/week) internship and also register for classes at the same time?\nYes, you can, but in such cases, we made a decision to limit course enrollment to a maximum of 2 additional\n3-credit courses.  Note that you must register for at least 2 credits during Fall or Spring semesters, even with\na full-time internship, in order to maintain part-time student status.\n \n7. How many credit hours of coursework do I have to register for if I'm doing internship in a given\nsemester?\nThis depends on the semester and the number of hours per week of internship. If it is a summer semester ,\nyou do not have to register for any courses except the 1-credit internship course, irrespective of whether the\ninternship is full-time or part-time. In Fall or Spring semesters, if you are doing a part-time internship, then\nyou have to maintain full-time student status by registering for at least 9 credit hours of graduate classes. If\nyou are doing a full-time internship in a Fall or Spring semester , the full-time internship is viewed as\nequivalent of full-time, on-campus enrollment, but you still have to maintain part-time student status, which\nmeans at least 2 credits of enrollment that semester (including the 1-credit internship course). Note that both\nfull-time and part-time internships are 1 credit per semester . \n \n8. I registered for classes full-time (9 credit hours or more) and later on during the semester , I got an\ninternship of fer. The employer gave me a joining date in the middle of the semester . Can I join this\ninternship?\nIf you have a full-time course load, you cannot do a full-time internship (more than 20 hours) during that\nsemester .  In such case, you will have to inform your employer that your internship will be a maximum of 20\nhours, and your of fer letter must state that.  The only exception is if you were registered for 3 courses, and\none of the three courses runs over the first half of the semester so that you have completed it by the time the\ninternship starts.  In that case, we will allow you to do a full-time internship.\n \n9. Why was my internship application declined by the MS-BAIS director?"", ""time. During this time, we will not allow you to be distracted by internships, GA/T A-ship, or other activities.\nNOTE: If you are an international students, and you have completed all the requirements for the program,\nyou cannot apply for an internship unless you also register for another course.  In other words, you cannot\npostpone your graduation by enrolling for an internship alone.\n \nWhat are the rules and restrictions on doing CPT internships? \nInternships may be full-time or part-time. You are allowed to do full-time or part-time internships for a\nmaximum of 364 days . Exceeding this limit will disqualify you from participating in the  Optional Practical\nTraining (OPT) upon completion of your degree. If you are an international student, you will need those 18\nmonths of OPT  to transition from the F1 student visa to a H1B worker's visa. You are therefore allowed a\nmaximum of 3 credits for CPT  internships.\nFor both full-time and part-time internships, you will have to register for the ISM 6945 (BAIS Internship)\ncourse for each semester that you do the internship, and demonstrate what curriculum-related knowledge\nyou acquired from the internship. Because all USF courses (including ISM 6945) are organized by\nsemesters, if you are doing an internship that starts in say July (Summer) and ends in September (Fall), then\nyou will need to register for ISM 6945 twice: for Summer and then again for Fall, for this internship, and this\ninternship will consume two of the three credit hours allowed for internships. You can use the same of fer\nletter for both internship applications, but the application for each semester must be submitted and\nprocessed separately .\nCPT internship positions must be for at least 8 weeks . If you have a Summer internship that is say 6 weeks\nlong, we will approve it only if it is also part of a Fall internship that is also at least 6 weeks in length. In this\ncase, you must fill out two internship applications, for the Summer and Fall semesters, and take a 1 credit\nclass in each semester .  \nWe allow some flexibility in your start and end dates for internships. You can start your internship up to two\nweeks before  the semester , as long as these dates don't overlap with a prior term, and end it up to two\nweeks after  the end of the semester , except in your graduating (last) semester at USF . In your final\n(graduating) semester , your internship must be completed by the of ficial end of that semester .\nYou are not allowed to do an internship and hold a GA  position in the same semester . You have to choose\nwhether you want the internship or the GA  position. W e do not want to recruit you as a GA  is you cannot\ndemonstrate your commitment to the GA  position and will quit it the moment you get a more lucrative\ninternship. W e will not approve your internship request once you are on USF payroll for your GA  job.\nYou are also not allowed to do a full-time internship, independent study , and register for classes (online or in-\nperson) in the same semester . This is to ensure that you spend adequate time and do a good job in\nwhatever you registered in for that semester .\n \nWhat are the course enrollment requirements for doing full-time or part-time internships in a given\nsemester?\nThe course enrollment requirements vary based on whether you are doing a full-time or part-time internship,\nand whether you are doing this internship in Fall, Spring, or Summer semesters.""]","The course enrollment requirements vary based on whether you are doing a full-time or part-time internship, and whether you are doing this internship in Fall, Spring, or Summer semesters.",multi_context,"[{'source': 'data/pdfs/CPT Internship FAQ_ ORG04655 _ MS-BAIS_AIBA Current Students.pdf', 'page': 0, 'filename': 'data/pdfs/CPT Internship FAQ_ ORG04655 _ MS-BAIS_AIBA Current Students.pdf'}, {'source': 'data/pdfs/CPT Internship FAQ_ ORG04655 _ MS-BAIS_AIBA Current Students.pdf', 'page': 1, 'filename': 'data/pdfs/CPT Internship FAQ_ ORG04655 _ MS-BAIS_AIBA Current Students.pdf'}, {'source': 'data/pdfs/CPT Internships_ ORG04655 _ MS-BAIS_AIBA Current Students.pdf', 'page': 1, 'filename': 'data/pdfs/CPT Internships_ ORG04655 _ MS-BAIS_AIBA Current Students.pdf'}]",TRUE
